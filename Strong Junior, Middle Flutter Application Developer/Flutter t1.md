# Test Application with posts

A test task to create a part of the application from scratch. 

## Goal

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Main task

Implement a Flutter application that should show the list of posts with comments (see the API details section below). The home screen must have a clickable list of posts and the name of the current user on the top (*user with id == 1 by default*). Clicking a cell of the list with posts should redirect the user to the next view controller with the list of post comments.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Bonus task

Add a button on the main screen (right top corner, icon for it you can find in the Assets folder) that should open a clickable list of the users. When a specific user is selected - the app should close the screen with the list of users and update the list of posts by the selected user.
